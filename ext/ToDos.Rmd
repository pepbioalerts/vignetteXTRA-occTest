## List of things to be incorporated/revised
0. Check output row index default. Why?
1. Better explain the native and invasive status range management in occTest. It is a bit confusing now.
2. Check sensitivity of each test
3. Filter directly those that have missingEnv_value ? Right now they belong a to a test block envOutliers
3. Mapping
4. Report on the filteing
5. Add dynamic alphaHull identification.
6. check ctryToIso3 function and the native resolver (F_nativeStatusCtry.R)
7. outputs when exiting should always be the same
