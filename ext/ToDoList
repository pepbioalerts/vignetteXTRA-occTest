ToDo WishList

- detecting centroids is slow. Possibly due to man for loops across rows. Maybe vectorize?

- Make an informative output path for the results
- Save them in the same folder so if we do the same in the same session for other species it can check on the downloads.

- Too verbose in the beginning fo the workflow. Make a function to assign parameter values
- Harmonize printed info with the header "WARNING" OR "INFO"

#checks to be donE
- add rworldxtra data package (recheck all the packages that are needed)
